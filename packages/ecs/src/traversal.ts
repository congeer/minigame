/**
 * A component that can point to another entity, and which can be used to define a path through the ECS.
 *
 * Traversals are used to [specify the direction] of [event propagation] in [observers].
 * The default query is `()`.
 *
 * Infinite loops are possible, and are not checked for. While looping can be desirable in some contexts
 * (for example, an observer that triggers itself multiple times before stopping), following an infinite
 * traversal loop without an eventual exit will cause your application to hang. Each implementer of `Traversal`
 * for documenting possible looping behavior, and consumers of those implementations are responsible for
 * avoiding infinite loops in their code.
 *
 * Traversals may be parameterized with additional data. For example, in observer event propagation, the
 * parameter `D` is the event type given in `Trigger<E>`. This allows traversal to differ depending on event
 * data.
 *
 * [specify the direction]: crate::event::Event::Traversal
 * [event propagation]: crate::observer::Trigger::propagate
 * [observers]: crate::observer::Observer
